abstract="It was not long after their discovery and subsequent molecular characterization that cytokines were tested for their therapeutic potential. This was only made possible by gene technology, which allowed sufficient amounts to be produced in good quality. Some of them --- INTERFERONS or the COLONY-STIMULATING FACTORS --- subsequently became established as drugs with great medical and even economic importance. Not all high-flying hopes, however, have been fulfilled, especially with regard to the treatment of malignant tumors. Thus, after a period of set-backs, new strategies have begun to evolve, which allow high local concentrations to be selectively generated, the most sophisticated approach involving the use of genetically altered cells.",
