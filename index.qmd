## Background {.winter .smaller}
Cytokines are small intercellular signalling protein that regulate immune responses by acting on various pathways

There are two types of cytokines (Type 1 or Type 2)^[@lucey1996type]:

- Type 1 favours the development of strong cellular immune responses
- Type 2 favour a strong humoral immune response

Regulatory mechanisms in the context of cytokine induced signaling is well studied but there is limited ability to link back these cytokine induced activities on all gene expression activity partially due to short half-lives and pleiotropy^[@jiang2021systematic]

## Question/Hypothesis {.winter}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="58%"}

- Can we leverage cytokine stimulated perturbation data to better understand gene expression using bulk RNA sequencing data comparing to control?

- Other than the interleukin genes (*IL-6*, *IL-10*, *IL-12*, etc.), which other genes demonstrate a change in expression level when a cytokine response is triggered?

**GSE231345**  
- aims to predict single cytokine-induced IL-6 and IL-10 macrophages to link gene expression and predict their activity in the JAK/STAT pathway

- Mice (Female C57BL/6J)
- Could analyze 3-5 cytokine stimulation studies to infer expression and develop more comprehensive mechanistic to prediction workflow


**GSE241939**

- Induces IL-12 on mouse BALBc cells to get maximal dosing information
- Their purpose was to use nanospheres as a method of drug delivery
- We repurpose their data to inform IL-12 stimulation on gene expression

**GSE220433**

- Uses an immune checkpoint inhibitor ibrutinib (acts on BTK gene) to block BCR pathway on mice to observe IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 production (used btk deficient mice to observe that effects of ibrutinib were not dependent on BTK signaling)

## Analysis Plan {.winter}

How will you answer your main research question?

- We propose performing differential expression analysis on a series of cytokine stimulated mice samples
- Next we will perform enrichment analysis to see what genes are influenced by the cytokine-specific stimulant comparing this with control
- We may propose some gene regulatory networks based on the relationships of genes and assess if the hub gene is the cytokine

```


::: {.notes}


**First**

- Apply DEA on many samples (3 dataset), start with 1 in depth
for EDA
- Gives gene list that are upregulated or downregulated --> exprs goes up or down --> so we know how cytokine influence sets of genes
- Hence bulk transciptomics gives us overview of what cytokine could influence  "signal" pathway --> inflamatory reactions --> immune responses

**Second**

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

- Enrichment analysis from previous identify genes list, looking for all gene against a database, and get annotations of why possible functions those genes carry
- Then from this understanding of relationship, we could perform some pathway analysis, so we know gene X affects gene Y and gene Y affects Z, A,B,C and so on
- Then we could "infer" and model these relationships by a regulatory network

**Third**

- Finally might consider given time, to look at single cell and ataq seq datasets and perform similar analysis to give better insights

- Hypothesize hub gene (any gene in the network interest) that has most neighbors, and relationships is likely to be cytokine

- If cytokine is being stimulated is it just one gene being hub or many?

**Other**

- Cytokine triggers many genes, so could affect proteins
- And could trigger many diff types of immune response, but hard to track given time it stays in a downstream gene
- Use mices to trigger a cytokine or cytkones of interests and repeat to see how if affects certain genes and if these cytokines affect other cytokines
